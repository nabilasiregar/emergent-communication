distance to target location from nest = num of times they waggle
resource direction = waggle direction angle 

Referential communication codes information, the dancer (sender) encodes the polar coordinates of a resource relative to the nest

Sender should know:
- polar coordinate of the nest node
- food quality (but does not matter if we only have 1 food source)

Sender's message contains:
- distance
- direction
